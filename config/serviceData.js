We provide a systematic, evidence-based approach to ensure your shoulder is prepared for surgery:

              </span>           
We focus on strengthening the muscles around the rotator cuff, including the deltoid and scapular stabilizers, to enhance overall joint stability.

              </span>
Through targeted stretches and manual therapy, we address stiffness, ensuring the shoulder can move freely and align properly for surgical correction.

              <span className="font-semibold text-gray-900 pr-1">

              </span>
Poor posture often exacerbates shoulder issues, so we incorporate training to optimize alignment and movement mechanics before surgery.
